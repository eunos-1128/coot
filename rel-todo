o filename filter for coords file open
  https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.FileFilter.html

o multi-select for maps

o arwen, alejandro, santosh, dorothee

o Add split water to new coot

o install latest chapi, python3 import coot_headless_api
  then the molecules_container_t gives an error message
  about COOT_PREFIX
* Not for me.

o 2vf7: alphafold model tutorial? Or is it too close to the actual model?

o Take a cif molecule, copy it, move the copy to symmetry-related position
  merge with first and write out the cif. Is the header (secondary structure)
  preserved in the outpute cif?

o std::bad_alloc when fitting waters in chapi - maybe.
  Put some protection in.

o 3pdt is Mg and should be K. A2.

o moorhen (and coot) ribbon diagram coloured by b-factor

o read in a moelcule, make a moelcule with DNA models. Refine DNA, then
  try to undo refinement of DNA. Fails. 8v1w.

o move make_directory_maybe() and get_directory() take std::string arg.
  Will need a change the header. Maybe a new header?

o Talk to Stuart:
::function get_atom not found - out of 386 docstrings
::function get_atom_using_cid not found - out of 386 docstrings
::function get_residue not found - out of 386 docstrings
::function get_residue_using_cid not found - out of 386 docstrings


--- Other Items ---

o "Flood the blob with dummy atoms" - useful of pomgnt2

o Add ability to rotate view around z axis :: 0.5

o auto-scale the make-a-difference map
  think about create power-matched option also? :: 1

o colour stops for b-factor analysis, rather than colour wheel. :: 1

o have another look at Rama plot :: 1

o Add curl fetch stuff to chapi api. Use modern accession codes.

o address-sanitizer for coot

o Fix the "Fetch" buttons - new GTK4/glib? :: 2

o "Proportional editing" molecule rotation :: 2
  Actually "fragment" rotation makes more sense.

o Get in touch with Kay for the display of h,k,l as atoms (cif)
* Done. Progress has been made.

o Atom sphere radius depends on B-factor - proportional to cube root maybe?
  set_atom_radius_by_b_factor_mode(imol, state)
  atom_radius_by_b_factor_scale_factor(imol, sf)

o draw 9c1h with molecular symmetry colouring :: 1
  turn on set_colour_by_ncs_chain(imol, 1)

o "Proportional editing" molecule rotation :: 2
  Actually "fragment" rotation makes more sense.

o try texture atlas for text - make a new test app from scratch :: 4

o WTA carbohydrate :: 6

o what does "RenameVerticesAndTriangles()" do? Do we need it?

o Cross-out "Screenshot" unless we have OpenGL 4.2 or later :: 0.5

o Highlight the chain neighbours in the Rama plot. Bring back the green square.

o how do I make the HUD buttons have rounded edges? Can I make the health bars
  have rounded edges?

o Rama and Rota graphs validation graphs have terrible scaling - difficult to fix :: 4

o Have a look at contact dots during refinement - with the 3a3a say, there is hang, and the
  final refined structure is shown - there is no animation :: 2

o Have a look at the poly-TRP problem of sequence identification. :: 4

o  It was a strange bit of code in get_group().
   Now the issue is duplication of the model on writing. mmdb bug.
   Solved now? Am I using the right version?

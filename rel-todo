o Get in touch with Kay for the display of h,k,l as atoms (cif)
* Done. Progress has been made.

o Atom sphere radius depends on B-factor - proportional to cube root maybe?
  set_atom_radius_by_b_factor_mode(imol, state)
  atom_radius_by_b_factor_scale_factor(imol, sf)

o draw 9c1h with molecular symmetry colouring

o load_gltf_model() should return the model index (-1 for failure)

o Fix the "Fetch" buttons - new GTK4/glib? ::: 2

o Add anisotropic radius scaling from Claus. Need to check mails or something
  for scaling code. ::: 1

o have another look at Rama plot ::: 1

o "Proportional editing" molecule rotation ::: 2
  Actually "fragment" rotation makes more sense.

o What is going wrong with Chemical Features? ::: 1
  wrong colour for hydrogen bond donors

o plug a mouse into the map and do middle-mouse drag for translation
  (and check ctrl-left-mouse) ::: 1

o write a blog-post for "APPLY-SYMMETRY::" label
  and up date the documentation.

o add a button for "vertex gradients for maps" in the EM module.

o boron is grey - it should be #FFA07A or so - pinky beige

o 6yzn - Overalaps etc validation hangs/is slow.

--- Other Items ---

o try texture atlas for text - make a new test app from scratch :: 4

o WTA carbohydrate :: 6

o what does "RenameVerticesAndTriangles()" do? Do we need it?

o Cross-out "Screenshot" unless we have OpenGL 4.2 or later :: 0.5

o Highlight the chain neighbours in the Rama plot. Bring back the green square.

o how do I make the HUD buttons have rounded edges? Can I make the health bars
  have rounded edges?

o Rama and Rota graphs validation graphs have terrible scaling - difficult to fix :: 4

o Have a look at contact dots during refinement - with the 3a3a say, there is hang, and the
  final refined structure is shown - there is no animation :: 2

o Have a look at the poly-TRP problem of sequence identification. :: 4

o  It was a strange bit of code in get_group().
   Now the issue is duplication of the model on writing. mmdb bug.
   Solved now? Am I using the right version?

o 1geh B-factor colour ramp looks wrong

o Message sent:
 Moorhen get monomer: needs
 - "read dictionary" or "import an new molecule for this ligand" choice
 - Also, not clear what is happening when there is no internet when the "OK" button is pressed.

--- Done Items ---

o Depythonize Replace Fragment ::: 1
* Done.

o Ctrl Scroll for zoom ::: 0.5
  Ah, shift-scroll already exists.
* Done.

o Fix Add Other Solvent Molecule dialog ::: 3
* Done.

o Get Monomer asks to download LZA from github despite  ::: 3

o Thierry Fischmann mail ::: 3
* Done.

o depythonize copy molecule ::: 0.3
* Done

o Validation json. ::: 2

o Fix the long "Atom with zero occupancy" bug - acutally, put it in the
  validation boxes ::: 2

o Select fitting map should be an overlay, I think. ::: 0.5

o B-factor of atoms around the centre of the screen ::: 1.5
  local_b_factor_display(short int state)

o mmcif/5-char ligand id/RSR - what's going wrong? ::: 0.5
  It was a strange bit of code in get_group().
  Now the issue is duplication of the model on writing. mmdb bug.
  Solved now? Am I using the right version?

o check 2d ligand view on new MacBook Pro. ::: 0.5
* is fine.

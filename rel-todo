--- Items ---

o Add ability to rotate view around z axis ::: 0.5

o auto-scale the make-a-difference map
 think about create power-matched option also? ::: 1

o what is the radius of gyration? Make a function. ::: 1

--- Other Items ---

o have another look at Rama plot :: 1

o Fix the "Fetch" buttons - new GTK4/glib? :: 2

o "Proportional editing" molecule rotation :: 2
  Actually "fragment" rotation makes more sense.

o Get in touch with Kay for the display of h,k,l as atoms (cif)
* Done. Progress has been made.

o Atom sphere radius depends on B-factor - proportional to cube root maybe?
  set_atom_radius_by_b_factor_mode(imol, state)
  atom_radius_by_b_factor_scale_factor(imol, sf)

o draw 9c1h with molecular symmetry colouring :: 1
  turn on set_colour_by_ncs_chain(imol, 1)

o "Proportional editing" molecule rotation :: 2
  Actually "fragment" rotation makes more sense.

o try texture atlas for text - make a new test app from scratch :: 4

o WTA carbohydrate :: 6

o what does "RenameVerticesAndTriangles()" do? Do we need it?

o Cross-out "Screenshot" unless we have OpenGL 4.2 or later :: 0.5

o Highlight the chain neighbours in the Rama plot. Bring back the green square.

o how do I make the HUD buttons have rounded edges? Can I make the health bars
  have rounded edges?

o Rama and Rota graphs validation graphs have terrible scaling - difficult to fix :: 4

o Have a look at contact dots during refinement - with the 3a3a say, there is hang, and the
  final refined structure is shown - there is no animation :: 2

o Have a look at the poly-TRP problem of sequence identification. :: 4

o  It was a strange bit of code in get_group().
   Now the issue is duplication of the model on writing. mmdb bug.
   Solved now? Am I using the right version?

o 1geh B-factor colour ramp looks wrong :: 1

--- Done Items ---

o remove GEMMI hack at top of atom-selection-container.cc ::: 0.2

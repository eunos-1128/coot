  Release Notes for 1.1.16

 o FEATURE: Local B-factor display

 o FEATURE: Built-in logging (started) - view it by clicking the "Log" button

 o FEATURE: Full doxygen documentation transfered to chapi nanobind functions

 o FEATURE: Anisotropic probability radius scaling (thank ClAuS Flensburg)

 o CHANGE:  For packagers: Now a commonly-used fragment of the monomer library
            is bundled with Coot. Unknown monomers are now downloaded from GitHub
            and cached using XDG Base Directory Specification

 o CHANGE:  For packagers: Now the reference structures are bundled
            with the source code (and installed) - no longer do they need
            to be a separate dependency

 o CHANGE:  If a map has a PANDDA:: or APPLY-SYMMETRY:: label then Coot now
            properly handles that (turns off "is-EM-map" status)

 o CHANGE:  Atoms with Zero Occupancy results now moved into the
            main window

 o CHANGE:  Boron atoms are now pinky-beige - like Jmol

 o BUG-FIX: Fix crash on adding an atom [Cl√©ment Bousquet]

 o BUG-FIX: Symmetry atoms are now clickable for distances and labels

 o BUG-FIX: Fix the non-drawn clashes post model update

 o BUG-FIX: "Add Other Solvent Molecules" dialog has been depythonized
            and now will work on macOS

 o BUG-FIX: "Copy Molecule" dialog has been depythonized and is now an
            overlay and now will work on macOS

 o BUG-FIX: Fix the problem of focus-grab when using Tutorial Model & Data

 o BUG-FIX: Fix the "Close" button in the Restraints Editor

 o KNOWN-BUGS: (that I looked at at but don't know how to resolve):
      - Ramachandran plot on macOS
      - Menu items that use targets on macOS
      (I suspect OpenGL driver bugs and GLib problems on macOS)

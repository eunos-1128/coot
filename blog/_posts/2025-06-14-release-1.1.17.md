There was a gemmi-related bug that can't wait for the next release.
I fixed a couple of other issues also, but it's mainly the gemmi one.

  Release Notes for 1.1.17

 o BUG-FIX: Save symmetry coordinates is fixed

 o BUG-FIX: Colour-by-B-factor colours are fixed

 o BUG-FIX: Place atom at pointer fixed

 o BUG-FIX: Optional Gemmi usage restored

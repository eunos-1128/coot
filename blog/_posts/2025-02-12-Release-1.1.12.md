  Release 1.1.12
  
  o source tar:

[https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/source/releases/coot-1.1.12.tar.gz](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/source/releases/coot-1.1.12.tar.gz)

  o TERMINAL OUTPUT: Coot's startup, in particular the graphics and Python, have
    lately been problematic (i.e. flaky/broken).  Different operating systems,
    different drivers, and different versions of Python add to the complexity.
    We have spent quite some time refactoring this - and especially so in the
    last few weeks. To help understand what is going wrong on startup I have
    increased the amount of diagnostic information on the terminal - so it's a
    bit ugly at the moment.
    When issues have been resolved and the startup is stable, I will reduce/remove
    the diagnostics.

  o FEATURE: new chapi functions:

    add_terminal_residue_directly()
    copy_molecule()
    flood()
    get_validation_vs_dictionary_for_selection()
    servalcat_refine_xray()
    get_torsion()
    change_alt_locs()
    split_residue_using_map()
    get_missing_residue_ranges()
    get_mutation_info()
    set_temperature_factor_using_cid()
    Pythonic API:

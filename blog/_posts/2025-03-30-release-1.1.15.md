            but not from CCP4i2)

 o CHANGE:  Fixed atoms are now draggable

 o CHANGE:  max-closeness is no longer used to filter peaks in map_peaks_py()

 o CHANGE:  Backtick for selection now also shows the residue range (if set)

 o BUG-FIX: Track-pad zooming fixed

 o BUG-FIX: Residue Info dialog buttons now on the right hand side

 o BUG-FIX: Fix and Unfix atom now work as expected

 o BUG-FIX: Remove erroneous "No ligands Found" dialog when ligand fitting
